                <b>Africa Now | Experiment 1</b> <br>
                Originally from Lusaka Zambia, I have lived in the U.S., Tunisia, and Egypt. I consider myself a global citizen but first and foremost I consider myself Zambian. As I complete this step in my studies I feel it is important for me to understand what it means to be an African artist or designer and what obstacles I may face with that identity. <br/>

                This semester I am focusing on contemporary African art and its place in the West and I hope to create an initiative that will help promote it. For my first approach I am putting on a series of workshops, one of which I have already completed. These workshops focus primarily on African artists, techniques and materials, giving attendees a chance to learn about the artists and create their own works in a similar style or with the same materials. The goal of these workshops would be to encourage a greater appreciation for contemporary African art and the traditions it stems from.<br/>
