With this thesis project I hope to create an initiative that will help to promote them. For my first approach I am putting on a series of workshops, one of which I have already completed. These workshops focus primarily on African artists, techniques and materials, giving attendees a chance to learn about the artists and create their own works in a similar style or with the same materials. The goal of these workshops would be to encourage a greater appreciation for contemporary African art and design and the traditions they stem from.<br/> ","                <br> <img src=\"memum.jpg\" alt=\"Me and mum\" style=\"max-width:445; max-height:600; padding-bottom:5;\">","                <div> Me and my mum 7|6|01 </div> <br>","            </div>","        </div>","        </div>","    </body>"],"id":56},{"start":{"row":24,"column":4},"end":{"row":47,"column":11},"action":"insert","lines":["   <body>","        <div class=outerwrapper>","            <div class=wrap>","                <div class=header><b>Unmasking Africa</b> </div> <br>","                <b>Unmasking Africa</b> <br> ","                Expanding the Outlook on African Art and Design <br>","                Through programming and workshops, the Unmasking","Africa initiative aims to promote a greater appreciation for","contemporary African art and design and a better understanding","of the traditions they stem from.
