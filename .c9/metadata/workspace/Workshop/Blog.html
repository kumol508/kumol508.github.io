For my first approach I am putting on a series of workshops, one of which I have already completed. These workshops focus primarily on African artists, techniques and materials, giving attendees a chance to learn about the artists and create their own works in a similar style or with the same materials. The goal of these workshops would be to encourage a greater appreciation for contemporary African art and design and the traditions it stems from.<br/> ","               <br> <br> <img src=\"memum.jpg\" alt=\"Me and mum\" style=\"width:185px\"> <br>","                <p class=smalltext> Me and my mum 7|6|01 </p> <br>"],"id":51}],[{"start":{"row":29,"column":16},"end":{"row":34,"column":1},"action":"insert","lines":["Week 1 | What Makes a Good Research Topic?","","Exploring the Physical","","My working topic is the global identities/cultures and acceptance. For my research exploring the physical, I visited the African art collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The specific piece I chose is Between Earth and Heaven by Ghanaian artist El Anatsui. Made in 2006, it is one of the most recently made acquisitions in the Met’s collection of African art. As an African artist and designer living in the United States I think it is important for me to see how my work would be accepted and presented in the real world. Taking a look at the pieces in the Met’s collection, Anatsui is one of the few pieces from the 21st century. This piece stands out in comparison the others it is surrounded by in its form and scale. A contemporary piece, Anatsui composed this large-scale piece out of recycled metal and bottle caps. He weaves the scraps together to create a piece similar to a traditional textile. The other pieces surrounding Anatsui’s are typical of acquired art pieces from collectors or explorers to African colonies. It is extremely refreshing to see Anatsui’s piece in a permanent collection representing the continent. However, I feel the collection as a whole lacks contemporary pieces."," "],"id":52}],[{"start":{"row":30,"column":0},"end":{"row":31,"column":0},"action":"remove","lines":["",""],"id":53}],[{"start":{"row":30,"column":0},"end":{"row":30,"column":4},"action":"insert","lines":["    "],"id":54}],[{"start":{"row":30,"column":4},"end":{"row":30,"column":8},"action":"insert","lines":["    "],"id":55}],[{"start":{"row":30,"column":8},"end":{"row":30,"column":12},"action":"insert","lines":["    "],"id":56}],[{"start":{"row":30,"column":12},"end":{"row":30,"column":16},"action":"insert","lines":["    "],"id":57}],[{"start":{"row":31,"column":0},"end":{"row":32,"column":0},"action":"remove","lines":["",""],"id":58}],[{"start":{"row":31,"column":0},"end":{"row":31,"column":4},"action":"insert","lines":["    "],"id":59}],[{"start":{"row":31,"column":4},"end":{"row":31,"column":8},"action":"insert","lines":["    "],"id":60}],[{"start":{"row":31,"column":8},"end":{"row":31,"column":12},"action":"insert","lines":["    "],"id":61}],[{"start":{"row":31,"column":12},"end":{"row":31,"column":16},"action":"insert","lines":["    "],"id":62}],[{"start":{"row":29,"column":16},"end":{"row":29,"column":17},"action":"insert","lines":["<"],"id":63}],[{"start":{"row":29,"column":17},"end":{"row":29,"column":18},"action":"insert","lines":["b"],"id":64}],[{"start":{"row":29,"column":18},"end":{"row":29,"column":19},"action":"insert","lines":[">"],"id":65}],[{"start":{"row":29,"column":19},"end":{"row":29,"column":20},"action":"insert","lines":[" "],"id":66}],[{"start":{"row":29,"column":62},"end":{"row":29,"column":63},"action":"insert","lines":[" "],"id":67}],[{"start":{"row":29,"column":63},"end":{"row":29,"column":64},"action":"insert","lines":["<"],"id":68}],[{"start":{"row":29,"column":64},"end":{"row":29,"column":65},"action":"insert","lines":["/"],"id":69}],[{"start":{"row":29,"column":65},"end":{"row":29,"column":66},"action":"insert","lines":[">"],"id":70}],[{"start":{"row":29,"column":65},"end":{"row":29,"column":66},"action":"insert","lines":["b"],"id":71}],[{"start":{"row":29,"column":67},"end":{"row":29,"column":68},"action":"insert","lines":[" "],"id":72}],[{"start":{"row":29,"column":68},"end":{"row":29,"column":69},"action":"insert","lines":["<"],"id":73}],[{"start":{"row":29,"column":69},"end":{"row":29,"column":70},"action":"insert","lines":["b"],"id":74}],[{"start":{"row":29,"column":70},"end":{"row":29,"column":71},"action":"insert","lines":["r"],"id":75}],[{"start":{"row":29,"column":71},"end":{"row":29,"column":72},"action":"insert","lines":[">"],"id":76}],[{"start":{"row":30,"column":38},"end":{"row":30,"column":39},"action":"insert","lines":["<"],"id":77}],[{"start":{"row":30,"column":39},"end":{"row":30,"column":40},"action":"insert","lines":["b"],"id":78}],[{"start":{"row":30,"column":40},"end":{"row":30,"column":41},"action":"insert","lines":["r"],"id":79}],[{"start":{"row":30,"column":41},"end":{"row":30,"column":42},"action":"insert","lines":[">"],"id":80}],[{"start":{"row":31,"column":1225},"end":{"row":31,"column":1226},"action":"insert","lines":[" "],"id":81}],[{"start":{"row":31,"column":1226},"end":{"row":31,"column":1227},"action":"insert","lines":["<"],"id":82}],[{"start":{"row":31,"column":1227},"end":{"row":31,"column":1228},"action":"insert","lines":["b"],"id":83}],[{"start":{"row":31,"column":1228},"end":{"row":31,"column":1229},"action":"insert","lines":["r"],"id":84}],[{"start":{"row":31,"column":1229},"end":{"row":31,"column":1230},"action":"insert","lines":[">"],"id":85}],[{"start":{"row":32,"column":0},"end":{"row":32,"column":4},"action":"insert","lines":["    "],"id":86}],[{"start":{"row":32,"column":4},"end":{"row":32,"column":8},"action":"insert","lines":["    "],"id":87}],[{"start":{"row":32,"column":8},"end":{"row":32,"column":12},"action":"insert","lines":["    "],"id":88}],[{"start":{"row":32,"column":12},"end":{"row":32,"column":16},"action":"insert","lines":["    "],"id":89}],[{"start":{"row":32,"column":16},"end":{"row":34,"column":1277},"action":"insert","lines":["Exploring the Digital","","For my exploration of the digital, I selected the article, “Understanding Contemporary African Art’s Hard-won Rise to the Art World Main Stage.” Written by Julie Baumgardner for an Artsy editorial, this article is centered around Ugochukwu-Smooth C. Nzewi’s exhibit Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner? that took place at the Richart Taittinger Gallery in New York in 2015. This article is directly related to my thesis topic on both a global and personal scale. Baumgarder and Smooth discuss the rise and gradual acceptance of African art in the Western art world and address the previous lack of representation of contemporary work from the region. I was also particularly interested in was his point about “globalization versus ghettoization” and how the latter, as he explains, represents “the burden of Africanness.” When curating his exhibit, Smooth was sure to select pieces that weren’t the obvious stereotypical African art. The pieces as he said, “address those contexts of familiarity but at the same time transcend and consider the universal.” The exhibit and the article touch on how these artists pull from their heritage and identity in creating their works, but their art isn’t necessarily defined by that and can live independently in the art world on a global scale."],"id":90}],[{"start":{"row":34,"column":1277},"end":{"row":34,"column":1278},"action":"insert","lines":["<"],"id":91}],[{"start":{"row":34,"column":1278},"end":{"row":34,"column":1279},"action":"insert","lines":["b"],"id":92}],[{"start":{"row":34,"column":1279},"end":{"row":34,"column":1280},"action":"insert","lines":["r"],"id":93}],[{"start":{"row":34,"column":1280},"end":{"row":34,"column":1281},"action":"insert","lines":[">"],"id":94}],[{"start":{"row":32,"column":37},"end":{"row":33,"column":0},"action":"remove","lines":["",""],"id":95}],[{"start":{"row":33,"column":0},"end":{"row":33,"column":4},"action":"insert","lines":["    "],"id":96}],[{"start":{"row":33,"column":4},"end":{"row":33,"column":8},"action":"insert","lines":["    "],"id":97}],[{"start":{"row":33,"column":8},"end":{"row":33,"column":12},"action":"insert","lines":["    "],"id":98}],[{"start":{"row":33,"column":12},"end":{"row":33,"column":16},"action":"insert","lines":["    "],"id":99}],[{"start":{"row":32,"column":37},"end":{"row":32,"column":38},"action":"insert","lines":["<"],"id":100}],[{"start":{"row":32,"column":38},"end":{"row":32,"column":39},"action":"insert","lines":["b"],"id":101}],[{"start":{"row":32,"column":39},"end":{"row":32,"column":40},"action":"insert","lines":["r"],"id":102}],[{"start":{"row":32,"column":40},"end":{"row":32,"column":41},"action":"insert","lines":[">"],"id":103}],[{"start":{"row":32,"column":16},"end":{"row":32,"column":17},"action":"insert","lines":["<"],"id":104}],[{"start":{"row":32,"column":17},"end":{"row":32,"column":18},"action":"insert","lines":["b"],"id":105}],[{"start":{"row":32,"column":18},"end":{"row":32,"column":19},"action":"insert","lines":["r"],"id":106}],[{"start":{"row":32,"column":19},"end":{"row":32,"column":20},"action":"insert","lines":[">"],"id":107}]]},"ace":{"folds":[],"scrolltop":174,"scrollleft":0,"selection":{"start":{"row":32,"column":20},"end":{"row":32,"column":20},"isBackwards":true},"options":{"guessTabSize":true,"useWrapMode":false,"wrapToView":true},"firstLineState":{"row":9,"state":"start","mode":"ace/mode/html"}},"timestamp":1477353341153,"hash":"5633e94c4bd891b83d24aed3bf998cfeea4ddc1a"}
