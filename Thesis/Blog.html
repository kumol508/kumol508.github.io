                <b> What Makes a Good Research Topic? </b> <br>
                <i>Exploring the Physical</i><br>
                My working topic is the global identities/cultures and acceptance. For my research exploring the physical, I visited the African art collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The specific piece I chose is Between Earth and Heaven by Ghanaian artist El Anatsui. Made in 2006, it is one of the most recently made acquisitions in the Met's collection of African art. As an African artist and designer living in the United States I think it is important for me to see how my work would be accepted and presented in the real world. Taking a look at the pieces in the Met's collection, Anatsui is one of the few pieces from the 21st century. This piece stands out in comparison the others it is surrounded by in its form and scale. A contemporary piece, Anatsui composed this large-scale piece out of recycled metal and bottle caps. He weaves the scraps together to create a piece similar to a traditional textile. The other pieces surrounding Anatsui's are typical of acquired art pieces from collectors or explorers to African colonies. It is extremely refreshing to see Anatsui's piece in a permanent collection representing the continent. However, I feel the collection as a whole lacks contemporary pieces. <br>
                <br><i>Exploring the Digital</i><br>
                For my exploration of the digital, I selected the article, "Understanding Contemporary African Art's Hard-won Rise to the Art World Main Stage." Written by Julie Baumgardner for an Artsy editorial, this article is centered around Ugochukwu-Smooth C. Nzewi's exhibit Guess Who's Coming to Dinner? that took place at the Richart Taittinger Gallery in New York in 2015. This article is directly related to my thesis topic on both a global and personal scale. Baumgarder and Smooth discuss the rise and gradual acceptance of African art in the Western art world and address the previous lack of representation of contemporary work from the region. I was also particularly interested in was his point about "globalization versus ghettoization" and how the latter, as he explains, represents "the burden of Africanness." When curating his exhibit, Smooth was sure to select pieces that weren't the obvious stereotypical African art. The pieces as he said, "address those contexts of familiarity but at the same time transcend and consider the universal." The exhibit and the article touch on how these artists pull from their heritage and identity in creating their works, but their art isn't necessarily defined by that and can live independently in the art world on a global scale.<br>

                <b>From Topics to Questions</b> <br>
                <i>Primary Research</i><br>
                In the museum setting, curators greatly influence what work is seen by the public and how it is presented to them. I think it would be fruitful for my topic to reach out to curators of contemporary galleries, fairs and museums and interview them about their experiences with showing African art, if there are any obstacles that arise, or if there is even a strong interest from the higher ups in their institutions. Furthermore, I would like to specifically look at the Africa Center and their methods in community engagement and youth education as some of their programs align with my first experiment. <br>

                In this article, Ghanaian-British architect David Adjaye speaks about his global upbringing and the influence it has had on his practice, his hopes and intentions for the design of the National Museum of African American History and Culture, as well as how he uses his practice for social change.

                This article gives a recap of the 1:54 Contemporary African Art Fair's second run here in New York. Established in London, the fair serves "as a platform that strives to represent multiplicity and showcase the diversity of contemporary African art and cultural production on an international stage."<br>

                In this quick interview, okayafrica speaks with Fab 5 Freddy, who is currently serving as the Chief Creative Consultant of the Africa Center here in New York, about the future for contemporary African art at the 1:54 art fair and beyond. <br>

                <b>Experiment 1 and Individuals </b> <br>
                After the peer critique this week I was able to come up with two directions that combine many of the elements in my rough sketches. The first would be an art workshop open to artists of any age and background. These workshops would focus primarily on African artists and their techniques, giving attendees a chance to learn about the artists and create their own works in a similar style or with the same materials. Hopefully this would encourage a greater appreciation for the style of contemporary African art that is happening now. It can also serve as a way for African artists living away from home to have a tie to their heritage. <br><br>
                The second direction I discussed would have a similar set up but would be directed towards children. It could include the art workshops and museum visits as well as lessons on the artists and their countries. This program would not only allow children to learn more about different cultures but it would give them the chance to express themselves creatively. I would hope to do this both in New York and Lusaka and create some sort of art exchange or pen pal connection between the two groups of children.<br><br>
                For this portion of the experiment, the individuals I would reach out to would be teachers or professors knowledgable in the subject area, contemporary artists, and a group like the Africa Center that leads a summer youth program. My outreach will be primarily through email. I would hope to gain insight from the professors about their experiences teaching people of various backgrounds about African art and possibly reach out to them to assist with the workshop. In addition, I would also reach out to the program organizers as a source of inspiration or collaboration. Finally, I would select one or two contemporary artists to do research on and contact in order to understand their work and process better. Ideally it would be amazing to have them participate in the workshop and give a demo.
