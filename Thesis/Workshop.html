                The first workshop took place on October 16th and had five artists in attendance. The focus for this workshop was Chitenge material. This waxed cotton fabric comes in various patterns and is popular throughout the Africa region. Commonly used as fabric for clothing or wrapped around the waist, chitenges are also popularly used to carry a child - or 'kupapa' as it is called in Nyanja, one of the main languages spoken in Zambia. <br/>
                The attendees were given the materials and were open to work with them to create their own pieces.<br>

                Adding to the experience, I provided the attendees with two popular snacks. The first was biltong, which is a dried beef snack. The attendees also enjoyed  vitumbuwa, fritters, that I made myself following my grandmother's recipe. Both snacks were devoured by the end of the workshop!<br>

                In addition to giving the participants background on the material being used, I also gave two examples of contemporary designers from the region that embrace and work with the fabric. The Bombchel Factory, is a line founded by Archel Bernard in Monrovia, Liberia. I had the opportunity to speak with Archel Bernard at an artist talk in Washington, DC. I was drawn to the strong social mission behind the Bombchel Factory and the opportunities she is creating for the women in her community. The company provided a wonderful example of the success coming out of independent businesses and artists that fully embrace the resources available in the region. <!-- My conversation with Archel also gave me insight on some of the issues facing African artists trying to make their work available on a global scale.--> By employing women that have overcome difficult circumstances as a result of health, political, and economic troubles in the country, Archel has created a company that appeals to the cool girls of Monrovia and changes lives along the way. <br>The second example, fashion line Popoka by Lupupa Kabezya-Lewis, is based in Lusaka, Zambian. Known for their simple elegance, the line blends the traditional and modern to create pieces for confident curvier women.<br><br>
