                    It was fun and exciting to try a new material which is so important in another culture.<br> </div>

                <div class="quote2"> "At first, it was rather difficult to get started -- but the workshop leader very effectively communicated which directions we could go in and started the flow of the creative process. Once we were on track, it was not difficult, and instead very fun." <br></div>
                <div class="quote2">"It is always interesting to work with materials of other cultures. The fabric, colour and pattern vary." <br> </div>
                <div class="quote2">"We were given just enough instructions. The workshop leader was very helpful in explaining the premise of the workshop, but keeping it open enough to allow us to make our own creations." <br></div>
                <div class="quote2">"I tend to find fabric difficult to use in a paper context (collage) because of the threads but I loved the sturdiness of the fabric" <br></div>
