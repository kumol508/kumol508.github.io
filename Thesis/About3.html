                <b>Expanding the Outlook on African Art and Design</b> <br>
                Through programming and workshops, the Unmasking
Africa initiative aims to promote a greater appreciation for
contemporary African art and design and a better understanding
of the traditions they stem from. These workshops have various
topics or "spotlights" including artists, techniques and materials.
Attendees are able to learn about contemporary African artists
and create their own works. With a limited number of attendees,
these intimate workshops are a space open to discussion and
offer a memorable experience.<br><br>
                <b>Likando Kumoyo </b> <br>
                Originally from Lusaka, Zambia and having lived in the U.S., Tunisia, Egypt and France Likando has a global perspective and openness to different cultures. However, as she evaluated the future opportunities of her artistic career, it was evident that there are certain obstacles facing contemporary African artists and designers due to the lack of cultural understanding and representation in the Western art world. <br>
                This became the inspiration and focus for her Thesis year project and developed into the Unmasking Africa workshops. <br/>
